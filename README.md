# Terminal POC

A proof of concept terminal written in Rust.

Currently cycles between multiple virtual terminals with their associated ptys.  This is very similar to something like tmux.  Eventually we want to add a GPU based renderer in addition to a terminal based one.

Based heavily on code from Alacritty: https://alacritty.org/
